The link to this website is https://vgusc.github.io/vguscfacespriter/
(I've also add a folder of stock facial features and a hat for your convenience!)
However, the video feed only works on PC for now (sorry if you're more of a mobile device kind of person!)
Due to this, you'll have to send the link to yourself in a way that you can access through a computer.
Besides that, have fun! The possible ways you can express a new look or style are endless with this super-customisable face filter!
Now anyone can make the filter of their dreams and look like anyone or anything they like!

!!!IMPORTANT FOR FACE SCANNING TO WORK!!!:
1. Go here: chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features
2. Enable 'Experimental Web Platform' features.
3. Enabling this will allow for this function to actually work. It will not work if you don't do this.
